## overview
Whack-a-mole game made with vanilla JS. It can be played on both computer and mobile devices. 

#### notes 
I wanted to make [this project](https://tortaruga.github.io/vanilla-js-games/html/whackamole.html) a little less sad, so I put some friendly moles here and there, and added some music. 

I tried playing with the speed of the mole, so that it would be challenging but doable both on computers and smartphones. I think 600ms is the sweet spot, but I also think my dexterity is disappointing, and so I never manage to score more that 7 on my laptop.
